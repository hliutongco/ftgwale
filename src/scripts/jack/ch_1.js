    text: "The room's walls glowed a sterile, glassy silver, reflective chrome panels forming a neat grid on all four sides. There were cameras embedded in each corner of the ceiling, invisible save for the glint of the lens. His own mildly bewildered, mostly irritated face stared back at him from the opposite wall."

    text: "He stilled at the voice filling the small room. It had a distinctly masculine tone: smooth baritone notes sinking into him like a soothing balm, conveying amusement and caution and curiosity all in a few short syllables. The voice sounded unfamiliar but it was not one Jack minded hearing more of."

    text: "The Godzilla of muscle relaxants, maybe, like the imported black market crap in Pandora. But where and when did this guy get the chance to slip it into him? He tried to tease out any recollection of the previous day, but his memories slipped through his grasp like tendrils of fog. The last thing he clearly remembered was using Roland's ECHOcomm to taunt the vault hunters. But he had the uncanny sense that that particular event had taken place days ago. If not longer."

He knew Helios intimately, committed every inch of it to memory, mapped out every room himself and this place sure as shit wasn't one of them. There was a long, unnatural pause, and for the first time Jack sensed hesitation. Then the man finally added,"

    speaker: "???"
  },
  {
    text: "Jack's ears zeroed in on the word 'backup'. It was an oddly specific choice of verb and the subtle implications made his gut churn."

    text: "Scooting his body to the edge of the bed required a conscious orchestration of muscle, causing Jack to grimace from the effort. He slammed his finger against the button and heard a low hum followed by a mechanical buzz. Pink light squeezed into the room through a widening slit, temporarily blinding him. Elpis moonlight. His eyes adjusted after several drawn out blinks, and when he caught a clear glimpse of the moon, he immediately understood what the man wanted him to see."
